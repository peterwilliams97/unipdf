Statement
of Mr Łukasz Porażyński, Director of International Cooperation Department,
Ministry of Development, Poland
at the plenary session of the WTO MC11 on 12 th December 2017

Mr Chairman,
Ministers,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen

Poland, as in previous years, and like the whole EU, is willing to constructively participate in the
veryimportant discussion and decision-making process during this 11th WTO Ministerial Conference.
We do appreciate numerous positive effects of international trade system perceptible on
microeconomic as well as macroeconomic levels. From amicroeconomic perspective, the transparent,
fair and rule-based world trading system allows domestic companies to reduce transaction costs and by
that increase the level of their internationalization. As a result, the business sector is able to better
fulfil the needs of our citizens. From amacroeconomic perspective, the effectively operated
international trade system is a key force stimulating economic growth, competitiveness of thenational
economy, innovations diffusion and structural transformation. It also supports country's participation
in the international division of labour.

Therefore we would like to express our constant support for the multilateral trade system
embodied and constituted by the WTO. We also see the need to continue cooperative efforts to
strengthen this system in order to create a solid pillar for a long-term economic as well as social
development of all WTO members.We are deeply convinced that the WTO is an important
institutional element of the global economic governance. For this reason, the government of Poland is
committed to further trade liberalization within the WTO and strengthening this Organization as a
guardian of themultilateral trading system. We would like to emphasize that the WTO might be also
regarded as an excellent example of a global public good. However, we also find a space for further
improvement of international trade system to make it more inclusive and efficient.

At the same time, we have to take into account the fact that the global economy changed
significantly in the last two decades. There are several new processes that have been occurring since
the DDA negotiation as well. The role of electronic commerce has increased in the global trade as well
as the role of digital economy as such. Knowledge-based economy, creative economy, patent
industries and intellectual property trade become paradigms in academic and political discourse
concerning future evolution of economic growth’s sources. Therefore, such visible shift has animpact
on foreign trade forms and scales. It should be noted that according to UNCTAD researchthe e-
commerce market is worth nowadays over 22 trillion USD. New perspective and opportunities are
opening for developed and developing countries in the digital economy era. It is also worth to mention
that we still observe an increasing role of services in the global trade. Furthermore, the complexity of
modern manufacturing increases the importance of global value chains whereas the needs of
environmental protection exert strong pressure to stimulate the creation of more favorable conditions
for products and technologies exchange in this respect. These new trends in international trade must be
addressed by the WTO to meet public and business expectations. This is also of great importance to
preserve thehigh relevance of the Organization for international trade in the future.

We would like to underline the importance of further strengthening of the existing rules and
mechanisms built inthe WTO. In this context, the relevance of Dispute Settlement system as well as
notifications should be emphasized. Both elements are being perceived by Poland to bethecrucial
pillars of the Organization and the key building blocks of the international trading system. Therefore,
they both should be strengthened and developed in order to improve the functioning and general
efficiency of the Organization.

Making Type 1 fonts for Vietnamese

Abstract
In this article I describe how I made the VNR fonts and converted them to Type 1
format. VNR is the Vietnamese version of the CMR fonts, written in METAFONT
based on CMR and EC font sources. Conversion to Type 1 format was done based
on the Type 1 version of CMR produced by Blue Sky, with the help of MetaFog,
FMP, FontLab and a lot of hacking in VNR sources and Bash and Perl scripting.
The result is a set of Type 1 fonts that is similar to the Blue Sky fonts, but also
provide Vietnamese letters with the same quality of outlines and hints.

Volovich convinced me that it would be better to
switch to EC sources instead of CMR sources. The
two main reasons:

1. it would be easier to include Vietnamese letters
in CM-Super fonts;

2. it would fix some problems in VNR (mainly with
encoding and some missing glyphs).

So I changed VNR to be based on EC, which of
course introduced new problems. The most notice-
able is with naming: Should VNR fonts be named
with an EC-like naming convention (vnrm1000.mf)
or a CMR-like naming convention (vnr10.mf)? In
the end I decided to support both, but the sources
(and thus the glyph shapes) are EC-based. Why not
drop one of them? Because:

1. I wanted to support EC naming, so Vladimir
could include Vietnamese letters in CM-Super;

2. I wanted to support CMR naming, because I
wanted to use the Type 1 version of CMR fonts.
Also, there are many packages which depend on
CMR-style names (such as Texinfo).

I would like to point out that I am not a type
designer and therefore the aesthetic aspect of Viet-
namese letters (regarding accent shapes and posi-
tioning) is open to discussion. What I have done
is heavily based on what I learnt from other Viet-
namese fonts available to me, from the typography
of other languages (mainly Czech and Polish), and
from comments from various people. It’s not to say
that I take no responsibility for VNR fonts. If some-
thing looks bad, it is of course my fault.

It’s good that I can use Vietnamese with
TEX, but I want PDF

fonts just look ugly in Acrobat Reader. So I
needed Type 1 fonts. My first attempt was to create
a set of virtual fonts for Vietnamese, which refer
to CMR fonts. Unfortunately, the output simply
doesn’t look good, as many needed accents are not
available in CMR and must be substituted by some
other glyphs.
I also tried to use TEXtrace to generate Type 1
versions of VNR fonts (using both EC and CMR nam-
ing). The result is useable, but the size is too large
and the quality of auto-generated outlines and hints
cannot be compared to Blue Sky fonts. It seemed
a pity to me that I could not use the high-quality
outlines and hints of English letters in the Blue Sky
fonts. So I looked for another method to convert
VNR fonts to Type 1 format.

Reuse is a good idea

The main idea of efficient generating Type 1 format
for VNR fonts is simple:

1. Take the accents from METAFONT sources and
convert them to Type 1 format;
2. compose those accents and the English letters
from Blue Sky fonts to get accented letters.

Thus nothing is new; each step is just a reuse of
existing data.

Use the right tool for each task

The two steps mentioned above can be done prop-
erly, given that we have the right tool for each.

Converting the accents to Type 1 format This
can be done very quickly using TEXtrace, or nearly
perfectly using METAPOST and MetaFog. As I had
an evaluation copy of MetaFog and I wanted the
result to be as good as possible, I chose the latter.
In this step, some glyphs that are needed in
T5 (the Vietnamese TEX encoding) but are miss-
ing in the Blue Sky fonts must also be converted.
The number of glyphs needed for each font is 47, of
which 22 are Vietnamese accents and letters. Ta-
ble 3 shows all the glyphs that need to be converted
to Type 1 format. The vl and vu prefixes stand for
“Vietnamese lowercase” resp. “Vietnamese upper-
case”. At the moment they look identical; however,
they may be changed.
Many of the additional glyphs are available in
the Blue Sky fonts already, but their availability is
not consistent. Each of the additional glyphs listed
here is missing at least in some Blue Sky font. To
get rid of this headache, I chose to convert them all.
47 glyphs is quite a large number for each font,
as the total number of glyphs to be converted is
2585 (47×55). Fortunately, not all of them required
manual correction, and the additional glyphs need to
be converted only once, given that EC sources will
not be changed. So, if I change the VNR sources,
I will have to re-convert only those 22 Vietnamese
accents and letters.
When MetaFog finished and we had the outlines
of the needed glyphs, hints for accents were auto-
generated using FontLab.
Several papers have been published on this topic
so I will not repeat it all here. (See References, Ed.)
In short, using METAPOST and MetaFog gives
the best result, but a lot of manual work is required.
That’s one reason why I didn’t convert all Viet-
namese glyphs but only those that are truly neces-
sary. Why regenerate the English letters when they
already exist in Blue Sky fonts at the high quality?

Radiofrequency Ablation for the Tieatment

Considerable advances have been made in both the understanding of and the curative treatment for atrial arrhythmias
over the last decade. Radiofrequency ablation of typical right atrial flutter and focal atrial tachycardia using standard
catheters is commonplace and is associated with success rates of over 957o. Recently developed 3-D mapping systems
have furthered our understanding of the complex circuits responsible for atypical atrial flutteis within the right and left
atrium and successful ablation of these previously incurable arrhythmias is now routinely achieved. With the seminal
discovery of pulmonary vein triggers and fixed left atrial circuits that are critical for the genesis and perpetuation of
atrial fibrillation, ablation techniques have been developed which are associated with cure rates of oui, is% for both

parorysmal and persistent forms of atrial fibrillation.

Atrial Fibrillation
trial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest sustained
l,I \ arrhythmia in clinical practice. The mechanisms
responsible for AF have been under active research

for many years, however, the current working hypoth-
esis suggests that AF develops because of an interplay
between factors responsible for initiating AF (triggering
atrial ectopic beats primarily arising from pulmonary

veins) and factors responsible for sustaining AF (such as
parasympathetic-sympathetic tone imbalance, increased
left atrial mass and high frequenry rotors or waves which

may revolve around left atrial scars or the pulmonary vein
ostia).
In the late 1990s Michel Haissaguerre and co-workers
from Bordeaux identified several patients with paroxys-
mal AF in whom AF was initiated by atrial ectopic beats
originating from the region of the pulmonary veins. Focal
RF ablation within the pulmonary veins at the site of the

triggering atrial ectopic beat was successful in preventing
further episodes of AF in a proportion of patients. This
landmark observation has spawned an intense research
effort directed at a hitherto unstudied area of arrhyth-
mology and has led to continuously evolving techniques

aimed at curing AF.
The first pulmonary vein ablation techniques involved
mapping and ablating the sites of earliest activation at the
beginning of an episode of AF. This/ocal ttpproach relied
on an episode of AF developing during the ablation pro-

cedure (which was not common). Subsequent techniques
have been modified to electrically isolate each pulmonary
vein from the body of the left atrium so as to prevent
all potential initiating pulmonary vein triggers from all

pulmonary veins reaching the left atrium. This technique
does not rely on AF developing during the procedure and
assumes that most AF episodes develop as a consequence
of pulmonary vein triggers. This segmental alilation tech-
nique involves the application of RF energy at the ostia of
each of the three to six pulmonary veins at specific sites
where electrical connections exist between the left atrium

and the pulmonary veins. These electrical conrrections can
be identified using circular catheters that are deployed at
the ostia of each pulmonary vein.
Developed in parallel with the segmental technique

by Carlo Pappone from Milan, the circumferential ablation
approach involves the construction ofablation circles prox-
imal to the pulmonary vein ostia. A 3-D mapping system
is required to perform this type of ablation in order to

register ablation points and to ensure that complete cir-
cle is created. This technique involves the ablation of a
greater volume of left atrial tissue and probably achieves
its effect through electrical isolation of the pulmonary
veins, modification of left atrial substrate and partial vagal

denervation.

General Indications for and Technique of AF
Ablation

Atrial fibrillation ablation is being increasingly performed
but should still be considered to be in a state oievolution.

Various complications of AF

ablation have been

described. Some are specific to achieving and maintain-
ing left atrial access and others occur as a consequence of
extensive ablation within the left atrium at locations imme-
diately adjacent to other important anatomic structures.

Local femoral vascular complications are rare and are no
more common than with routine EP studies. Transeptal
puncture may rarely be associated with pericardial tam-

ponade (0.1%) and percutaneous drainage is usually suc-
cessful. Stroke or transient ischaemic attacks may occur
with a frequency of <0.2'/" and seem to be more common
in patients older than 55 years. ACT levels of 35G400s

are recommended during the ablation procedure to min-
imise the possibility of left atrial thrombus developing.

Clinically relevant pulmonary vein stenosis is now rarely
reported (<0.1%) as ablation lesions are applied proximal
to the pulmonary vein ostia within the left atrial body. This
problem is more common with the segmental approach

than the circumferential approach. Oesophageal perfora-
tion is a rare (<0.03%) but potentially lethal complication
that has been described in patients undergoing linear

ablation with high power (>70W) lesions being applied to
the posterior left atrium with 8 mm ablation catheters. Fis-
tulas may develop between the oesophagus and left atrium
leading to polymicrobial septic emboli with devastating

Restricting power levels to 30W and not
performing linear ablation horizontally across the poste-
rior left atrium has reduced this complication. Emergenry
surgery for cardiac perforation or lasso catheter entrap-
ment within the mitral valve apparatus is rare (<0.1%).

with oirtual catheters aisible and ablation points marked.

Left atrial flutters have been described in 5-9% of
patients following circumferential ablation for AF and

are usually due to circuits anchored in regions of viable
myocardium between incomplete ablation lines. Occa-
sionally, left atrial flutters rotate around the mitral annulus
or around the ablation circles constructed at the time of
the ablation. These arrhythmias are much less common
following segmental ablation (<0.5%). The maiority of left
atrial flutters resolve spontaneously, however, ablation of

these arrhythmias may be required.

Following ablation, patients are anticoagulated for 3
months and may stay on antiarrhythmic drugs until they
are sequentially withdrawn over 3-5 months. Episodes
of AF are not uncommon in the first 3-6 months

following ablation and are not predictive of clinical

outcome.

Outcomes of AF Ablation
The long-term (12-24 months)

success rate of curing
paroxysmal AF without the need for ongoing antiarrhyth-
mic drug treatment with segmental or circumferential

is approximately 75%. Some patients may need to
continue with antiarrhythmic drugs to achieve complete
symptom control and previously ineffective suppressive
drug treatment may become effective after ablation in
an additional 10%. Up to 9O% of patients have either no
AF or a significant reduction in AF symptom burden fol-
lowing ablation. Success rates for curing persistent and

ablation

chronic forms of AF are generally less impressive although
many groups report no significant differences in results

between the various subtypes of AF. Recent studies have
also demonstrated significant improvements in left ven-
tricular function following AF ablation in patients with
heart failure and AF compared with standard medical

treatment.
